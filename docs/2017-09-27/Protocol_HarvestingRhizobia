Harvesting Rhizobia Protocol
For each batch of plants:
Chilled autoclaved dH2O from cold room
Autoclaved plastic pestle
1.5mL tube with 150ul of crushing buffer [crushing buffer = 1:1 mix of 1/2xPBS and 80% glycerol] Sterile petri dishes
Several pairs of forceps
Eppendorf rack to use as forcep stand
TY plates at room temp
Mini ice bucket [doubled square container] for inside hood to keep roots cold

Protocol
1. Root Washing
Outside the hood, wash root well in dH2O [on ice]. Remove all stray debris and attached soil particles. Do final rinse in clean dH2O
Place in sterile 15mL falcon tube, label
Record any observations on the roots--strange colors, shapes, fungus, etc.

2. Surface Sterilize Roots
Inside the hood, process batches of ~4 plants at once
Each plant gets 5-10mL of bleach solution -- start timer when bleach enters the first falcon tube; space out each by 30s
For the next 2 mins, gently agitate the root in the tube
At 2 min, pour off bleach solution with mesh covering opening and add cold sterile water for ALL of batch, mix well to remove bleach
Pour off rinse water, add 2nd rinse.
Repeat until 6 rinses have been completed.
Add enough water to the bag to submerge the root and keep on ice

3. Pluck & Crush Nodules
For each plant, count the number of nodules & record
Pre-label crushing tubes with the nodule ID
With flamed forceps (I like the tiny ones for plucking and serrated ones for holding the root), gently pluck individual nodules into crushing tube [close lid]
Measure each nodule in the tube & record nodule ID, size, and color. Keep nodules on ice in hood. Label one TY plate per nodule
Once ~20 nodules are plucked, crush each with a plastic pestle
Once crushed, use pestle to streak a good-sized drop onto a TY plate in a single, non-overlapping streak. The goal is to get a single colony from this streak.
Crushed nodules go in the -80C
Plates incubate at 30C in a plastic box with good lid to keep moist
